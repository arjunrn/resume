    {Since I come from a Software Development background I have extensive experience with programming in Python. I have also 
    developed and maintained large Java backend services. In the past year I have mostly developed automation and tooling in
    the Go language. For the past of couple of years I have been building infrasture in AWS. More recently I have started 
    working with Kubernetes and Terraform for deployment of 12-factor apps. I have used several continuous delivery tools
    like Jenkins, Gitlab-CI and GoCD for building deployment pipelines and other automation tasks.}
