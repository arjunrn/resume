\\
\\
It has been 10 years since I picked up a book on C programming. Since then I have been led deeper into the world of software development. My discovery of Python was the second biggest turning point. This sparked my interest in Web applications and subsequently Distributed Systems. 
\\
After obtaining a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering I spent 2 years working at a consultancy. Here I built the front-end for India's largest pizza chain. After that I moved to a startup where I built web applications and got interested in Android development. After working for 2 years in the industry I decided to continue my education in Germany. Studying at TU Dresden in the Systems Engineering chair has given me a unique opportunity to participate is several diverse research projects.

I am also deeply passionate about open-source and I try to contribute whenever I have the opportunity. I always encourage people to use and develop for open-source.

    {\bodytext{Netbramha Studios is a consultancy which develops beautiful and content intensive websites for their clients. I was hired right out of college to handle the technical aspects of maintaining these websites as well as minor front-end development. Some projects were built using third-party as well as in-house frameworks. My work mostly dealt with maintainence and improvement of these applications. For the front-end development I used jQuery and Dojo as well as some basic layout and styling with \acr{HTML+CSS}. As my responsibilities grew I was handed the task of developing a complete web-based front end for one of India's largest pizza delivery chains.}}

 {\bodytext{
 Locus Labs was at that time a seeded startup which developed apps for the Singapore market. The target audience were saavy shopper. The application {\href{http://www.notikum.com}{Notikum}} found offers for shoppers based on their profile. This involved collecting data from hundreds of websites. I was involved in the team which scraped the data using Scrapy(Python). This data was later indexed using Solr. I did this while concurrently developing and maintaining the website for this application. The surge in mobile apps necessitated that an Android app be development. I took over the development of this app after some initial work. 

After the startup pivoted I was given further responsibilities. I was put in charge of the development of the new product {\href{http://www.notiphi.com}{Notiphi}}. Location based advertising was the primary goal of this service. Advertisement were delivered to customers whenever they were in the vicinity of a pre-selected area. I designed and implemented the initial prototype with Tornado and PostgreSQL and also the relevant cloud infrastructure. I also leveraged my previous Android experience to develop the Android SDK which could be used by third-party developers to integrate this service into their apps.}}

This app was subsequently open-sourced and available on {\href{https://github.com/dmfs/tasks}{Github}}.I was also part of the team which developed an Android based {\href{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.schedjoules.calstore}{Calendar Store}}.
    
    But my primary role was as a Django developer. I developed a web application for the bulk-retail of mobile applications. The application used OpenSSL cryptography to sign and verify the source of the applications. Only applications with a valid key issued from the website could be activated. The Android SDK which integrates with the third-party app to provide this functionality was also developed by me.

The software solution consisted of several service which were responsible for converting, indexing and storing the data. I developed a monitoring mechanism using Monit which kept track for all the individual hardware units and monitored for performance changes after updates.

I worked with a team which developed a translator for C programs. The C program were translated into a subset of C which can be encoded for redundant operations to ensure correct execution even in the event of bit-flips or other random transient errors.

More recently I have been working with distributed coordination services like ZooKeeper and Consul. I have been evaluating the impact of the respective protocols(ZAB and Raft). One of my duties also includes the implementation of new features to Kazoo, a Python client library for Zookeeper.

        After securing a rank of 446 among more than 200,000 other University examination students I was granted a scholarship by the state government. I was also one of editors of the College newsletter and also a regular contributor. My major was in Computer Science with a focus on Computer Architecture. I also took elective courses in Compiler Design and Discrete Mathematics. For my final year project I developed a Wi-Fi enable robot which could be controlled over the internet. It also had a plethora of sensors which guided in navigation and control.

  {Technical Specialities:}
  {My biggest technical skill is that I have an interest in a variety of programming language. I quickly learn and put to use any programming language which is required for the task at hand. However, Python is my favourite and go-to language for all occasions. I have used many Python based libraries and frameworks over the course of career. Django, Scrapy, Google AppEngine, Tornado, Fabric, pyOpenSSL are ones which I know best. I have also a good understanding of Frontend web technologies: \acr{HTML+CSS}, JavaScript(jQuery, Angular.js). I have also some experience with developing web applications using PHP, Ruby and node.js. All my projects are managed through Git or Mercurial. I also have substantial experience developing beautiful native Android applications. Most of my knowledge of Java comes from developing Android applications. Recently I have dabbled in Go and Haskell to solve some concurrency based problems for my courses. I also have some experience using and tuning databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and Redis. I have also been using Linux both professionally and for personal use. I have a good understanding of the architecture of Linux as well as how to use it effectively.
