\noindent \emph{A organised, meticulous, and determined software engineering with a focus on building distributed systems.}
\\
\\
It has been 10 years since I picked up a book on C programming. Since then I have been led deeper into the world of software development. My discovery of Python was the second biggest turning point. This sparked my interest in Web applications and subsequently Distributed Systems. 
\\
After obtaining a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering I spent 2 years working at a consultancy. Here I built the front-end for India's largest pizza chain. After that I moved to a startup where I built web applications and got interested in Android development. 
\\
After 2 years of working at a startup I decided to continue my education in Germany. Studying at TU Dresden in the Systems Engineering chair has given me a unique opportunity to participate is several diverse research projects.
