\noindent \emph{A software/devops engineer with a focus on reliability and performance of distributed systems.}
\\
In 2010 after completing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science I started working as a software Developer in a startup. I worked with diverse technologies and built applications for several platforms. But I always enjoyed working on the automation and infrastructure for those application. In 2012 I decided to continue my education in Germany. Studying at TU Dresden in the Systems Engineering chair gave me a unique opportunity to participate is several research projects and revisit the fundamentals of Distributed Sytems. After graduating in 2015 I decided to build my career as a Site Reliabiltiy Engineer. My goal is to work in an environment which fosters creativity and offers interesting challenges. Since I am a big proponent of open-source, I also wish that my work both utilises and contributes back to the opensource community.

      I was later moved to the Personalization department where I worked with the Recommendations team to deliver personalized item recommendations with strong Service Level Objectives. I continued automating the deployments of the their infrastructure and wrote other automation to manage their datastores like Elasticsearch and Cassandra. I also introduced monitoring for visualizing and observing the performance of various stages of the recommendations pipeline.

    {Since I come from a Software Development background I have extensive experience with programming in Python. I have also developed and maintained large Java backend services. I have been using Go for some time but consider myself a beginner. For the past of couple of years I have been building infrasture in AWS. More recently I have started working with Kubernetes and Terraform for deployment of 12-factor apps. I have used several continuous delivery tools like Jenkins, Gitlab-CI and GoCD for building deployment pipelines and other automation tasks.}
